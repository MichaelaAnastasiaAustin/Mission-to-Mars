# Mission-to-Mars

## Background

We have put together a web-scraping project that allows us to get the latest news and updates on Mars. We have been able to automate visiting the website to scrape the top news article (title and summary), full-size featured image, as well as display a facts table. Now, we are tasked with adjusting the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images.

## Overview

We are tasked with completing the following three technical analyses:

- Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

## Resources

VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, Splinter, Beautiful Soup, MongoDB, Web-Driver Manager

## Results

*Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles*
- We successfully printed the list of image URLs and titles for all four hemisphere images. See image below.

*Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles*
- We successfully updated the web app so that it contains all the information from this module and the full-resolution images and titles for the four hemisphere images. See image below.

*Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components*
- We successfully updated the web app to make it mobile-responsive, and added two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out (changed the main website title to blue text and italicized the title of the latest Mars news article). See image below.
